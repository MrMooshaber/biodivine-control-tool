#AeonOnlineTool

    Web based tool for performing operations over boolean networks (fully and partialy defined).

    Functions:
      modification of the network (model) - adding nodes, adding regulations,
                                              renaming nodes, modification of the update functions

      attractor analysis - analysis of possible attractors of the network, 
                              visualisation of the attractor analysis results (with bifurcation tree and attractor explorer)
            
      control computation - setting controllable nodes, setting phenotype,
                              setting parameters of the control computation, visualisation of the computed control results
