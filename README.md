# biodivine-control-tool
Tool for control over partially specified boolean networks.

Will include:
1.predesigned scenarios for control tasks (working perturbations, subsets of perturbations, ...)
2.free mode for the manipulation of the control parameters
3.posibility to export/load calculated control data
4.ability to create graphs from the calculated control data
5.grafical interface for representation of the control results

Maybe will include:
1.analysis of the partially specified boolean network's colours through perturbations
2.AI based tools for analysis of the most viable perturbation
